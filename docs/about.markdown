## Curriculum

### Professional.
I'm an independent researcher on a sabbatical, focusing on studying artificial intelligence safety, having
done the training program of SERIMATS 3.0, under the supervision of Stuart Armstrong and Rebecca Gorman, and I am
currently pursuing an understanding of language models and their threat dynamics.

Before that,
I worked in the Interdisciplinary Nucleus for Fluid Mechanics as a research engineer (Jan 2020 - Aug 2022),
on physical and chemical models of scaling of calcium carbonate in pipe flows.

### Education
I am a Master in Mathematics from Univesidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (Aug 2017 - Sep 2019), with my Thesis topic on mixing Bayesian quadrature
and variational inference for Bayesian inference of hard-to-evaluate models, under the supervision of Fabio Ramos. During my Master's, I took part in the winning team of the
Financial Mathematics Team Challenge 2018, on the topic of using neural networks to solve PDEs commonly found in finances, while
also participating in a side project involving road traffic estimation.

My Bachelor's was
both in Mathematics and Materials Engineering, at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, working in research internships that range from hydrogen
diffusion models in steels to the use of Gaussian processes for radiation dose estimation, among others.
