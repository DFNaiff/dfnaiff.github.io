[GPT-4 just launched yesterday](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), if you didn't already knew of it. I used it to
create a minigame and I'm truly amazed. I acted mostly as a supervisor than anything,
because the code almost in its entirety is due to GPT-4. Although the title is Gravitational Golf, 
it is working more as a Gravitational Soccer. But it is still great.

Sometimes GPT-4 commited errors, but usually he himself corrected it. Of course,
here and there I corrected some errors myself, but they where minor. It was honestly
95% GPT and 5% me.

I'm kind of speechless, if I am to be honest. Just leaving the game here. It is on the "Golf" tab.
