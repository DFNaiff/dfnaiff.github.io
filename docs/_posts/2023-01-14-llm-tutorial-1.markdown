Linkpost: [A Tutorial on Large Language Models](https://dfnaiff.notion.site/A-Tutorial-on-Language-Models-1b14a09d5b234b6ab6bb2cffe6d3d8fb).

In the process of studying more in-depth language models, I am following the [curriculum by Jacob Hilton](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum).
The first exercise in that curriculum involves creating a language model from scratch, and training it on the works of Shakespeare.
Following the "learning by writing" philosophy, I decided to create a tutorial for large language models. The first part can be in the link above.

I'm still learning how to use Jekyll, so I'm having a hard time exporting the Notion file to here. As soon as this is done
that post will be available here.

Any useful comments you can just contact me.
