Hello. This is actually me beginning a personal website. I intend to blog on... whatever comes to my mind, really. Which lately is on AI alignment 
and large language models. But whatever comes to my mind will be here.

First thing that will come is a sequence of posts on large language models. You can already find the (in-progress) notion link for the part 1, 
explaining "pure models" such as GPT-2 and GPT-3, [here](https://dfnaiff.notion.site/A-Tutorial-on-Language-Models-1b14a09d5b234b6ab6bb2cffe6d3d8fb).
